## About

In this capstone project am going to build is based on an online website for a conference. We were provided with some design guidelines for us to create the website, but we must personalize the content, i.e., instead of a conference we could build a website for a concert or for a web development course. It's very important the we personalize our project so that we have something unique in our portfolio to share with potential employers during job searching.
